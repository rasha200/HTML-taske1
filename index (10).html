   <h2><ins>what is the introduction of math?</ins></h2> 
   <p>Mathematics is an <mark>area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers</mark>,
     formulas and related structures, shapes and the spaces in which they are 
     contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented 
     in modern.<br> 

     <p>Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of <b>abstract objects</b> and the use of pure
         reason to prove them. <ins>These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern</ins><mark> mathematics—entities</mark>
         <ins> that are stipulated to have certain properties</ins>,<ins> called axioms</ins>.<ins> A proof consists of a succession of applications 
          of deductive rules to already established results</ins>. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms,
           and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the 
           theory under consideration.[</p>

 <p><ins>Mathematics</ins> i<ins>s essential in</ins> t<ins>he natural sciences</ins>,<ins> engineering</ins>, medicine<ins>, finance,</ins> computer science, and the social sciences.
     Although mathematics is
      extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics<b> are independent from any</b> 
     scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics<b> such as statistics and game theory</b>, are developed in close correlation with their 
     applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics>. Other areas are developed independently from any application
      (and are therefore called pure mathematics)

    <h2><ins>introduction of chemistry</ins></h2>
    <p> <mark>the science that </mark>deals with the properties, <ins>composition,</ins><ins>and structure</ins> <ins>of substances</ins> (defined as elements and compounds),
         the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released or absorbed during these processes. Every <b>substance,</b>
          whether naturally occurring or artificially produced,<mark><i><ins> consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species of atoms</ins></i></mark> that 
          have been identified as elements.</p>
          <p><del>the great challenge in chemistry is the development of a coherent explanation of the complex behaviour of materials,
             why they appear as they do, what gives them their enduring properties, and how interactions among different</del> substances 
             can bring about the formation of new substances and the <mark>destruction</mark> of old ones. </p>
