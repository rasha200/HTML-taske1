    <h1>Cats</h1>
    <p><mark>Cats are of three types- house cats, farm cats and feral cats.
         House cats are the cats we pet in our houses. Cats become good friends of humans.
          Unlike dogs, cats are not very active around their owners. However,
           they are good emotional companions to their owners.

        <h2>Dogs</h2>
        <P><b>Dogs are carnivores, which means that they eat meat.</b>
             Pet dogs eat dog food made with meat products. Wild dogs hunt animals.
             Dogs claim territory and mark it as their own. They do this by urinating and rubbing their scent on things
             But dogs also like to be around people and other dogs. People can even train dogs to obey simple commands.
        </P>
